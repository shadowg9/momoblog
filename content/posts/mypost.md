I have finalized a new version of my Website Portfolio where it will be easier to peform updates and add in new projects I have worked on to showcase my programming abilities. Here is the link to my old website portfolio: http://react-web-portfolio.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/.

My main purpose for this site is to document my progress working on various projects and showcase what I have learned! 

```java
public static void main(String[]args) {
    System.out.println("This is a print statement to test out JavaScript.");
}
```
