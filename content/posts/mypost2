I have a goal of wanting to experiment with all the security tools provided by the Kali Linux Virtual Machine. I use VMware and at the moment have 16 GB RAM. I recently bought 64 GB RAM so I can have multiple applications, virtual machines, Microsoft tools, and programming IDEs open up without having to worry about maximizing my RAM capacity. It will come in a few weeks and that is when I will start experimenting with all the tools. I am a bit paranoid when it comes to data so I am backing up my drives just in case.
