Please list any relevant experience you have related to the role? (Certifications, coding languages, applicable coursework, extracurriculars, leadership positions, work experience)


- Full Stack Development Experience: Familiarized myself with making several full-stack web applications at Cognixia USA. A notable one, which was a car dealership web application, had its backend focused on SpringBoot with Eclipse and had the servers and database up on AWS. The Frontend used Visual Studio, and I was tasked with designing the webpage and fetching API's to have it be displayed on the webpage. I created and populated the tables using MySQL, and the data inputted included the vehicles available on the market and the users who registered on the webpage. The Backend used Java to handle all the business logic and used Springboot because it simplified the building process, allowed for dependency injections, and was used to connect to the database. We also used Git commands to constantly update our project by making push and pull requests from the repository. Lastly, the server and database were linked to AWS Elastic Beanstalk, while the website was being hosted on an S3 Bucket.


- Personal E-Commerce Project: A cumulative case of everything I have learned is developing a secure, cloud-integrated e-commerce web application for a colleague’s real estate business. The intended purpose was to simplify their workload by providing a streamlined user interface that allows them to manage property services. The full-stack platform I built consists of a front end using Visual Studio Code (HTML/CSS/JS, React), a back end using Eclipse IDE (SpringBoot Java), an integrated cloud database (MySQL database hosted on AWS RDS), and essential functionalities such as user authentication, CRUD operations, and data encryption. To ensure an easier time in deploying the environment, I used Docker to containerize the web application. These tools and technologies allowed my development process to maintain effectiveness, efficiency, and scalability to ensure my client was fully satisfied with the product. 


- Personal Data Engineering Project: I am currently working on a Scalable Data Lakehouse Pipeline for Sales & Marketing Analytics. This will greatly aid my understanding in simulating how real-world enterprises ingest large-scale customer log data. This project involves orchestrating an ETL pipeline with Prefect and ingesting sales and marketing data into Databricks. I will be using Delta Lake for optimized storage and querying and will implement dbt for data modeling and transformations. For CI/CD, I am going to configure GitHub Actions to automate testing and deployment across environments. While this is primarily a backend-data project, I will also design a minimal dashboard using React.js to visualize KPI metrics. I believe having this experience will reinforce my ability to work with modern data stacks.


- Strong Technical Foundation: 

- AI Trainer Role: I have reviewed LLM-generated data to ensure that its factual integrity corresponds to real life. In addition, I provided detailed feedback for improvements in phrasing, user experience, relevance, accuracy, and adherence to conversational guidelines. My time spent with DataAnnotation has honed my abilities to critique user experience and interface responsiveness with utmost accuracy, effectiveness, and efficiency, which are skills that can directly be applied to frontend optimization.
