Cybersecurity insights such as cryptography, SOC analysis, and secure software design. Experience with methodologies such as Agile, Scrum, and Waterfall. These wide array of technical skills provides me a diverse understanding into the interconnectedness and interoperability of differing technologies. This knowledge will be crucial for me in fully understanding the innworkings of the organization's particular set of tech stacks and grant me the necessary toolkits to confidently complete programming, database, and documentation based deliverables, and ensure security of the applications.\rStrong Academic Background\rI have remained very disciplined and conscientious for my courses and during my undergraduate years (2017-2021), I have remained on the Dean's Honor List for 5+ semesters and received an award for Magna Cum Laude at my last semester and received my Bachelors for Computer Information Systems with relevant courses such as Project Management, Secure Application Design, Cloud Computing Infrastructure and Archietcture, Enterprise Applications Development, Database Administration and Implementation, and Intrusion Response and Detection. I have also received my Masters in Cybersecurity (2023-2024) and received Sumna Cum Laude with a 3.934 GPA. My graduate work focused on advanced topics with the relevant courses pertaining to Network Security, Secure Enterprise Computing, Secure Software Design, Cybersecurity Tools, Cybersecurity Risk Management, Advanced SOC Analysis, and Applied Cryptography.\nThese academic achievements serves as a testament that my capabilities to handle the academic rigor will all translate seamlessly into a professional work environment. My time spent at the University of Houston has provided me with the foundation needed to deliver multiple applications and documentations with optimal effiency, effectiveness, and quality. Holistic Drive\rI have an insatiable thirst for knowledge and do not plan on slowing down. As my hobby, I study up on different philosophies, astrophysics, social sciences, and quantum mechanics. This quality of mines demonstrates my tenacity to strive for as much learning that can be provided for the given deliverables. Communication\rCommunication: I possess the ability to convey technical jargon to the layman in a fluent, digestible manner, as well as incorporate the nomenclature from fields concerning cloud, software development, and cyber security and relay accurate information to more knowledgeable programmers. Conclusion\rI currently possess a Master’s degree in Cybersecurity, a Bachelor’s in Computer Information Systems, a certification for AWS Cloud Practitioner, and am working towards acquiring a Security+ Certification. With my academic background, knowledge acquisitions, and personal projects, I have built a comprehensive technical foundation in secure software development and express a steadfast conviction that aligns with the organization’s commitment to technological excellence and demonstrating ethical behavior and integrity to uphold the company’s reputation and trust of the clients.

It is used for analyzing malware and penetration testing and is a valuable tool for users as it allows them to filter DNS queries, redirect traffic, and poison DNS servers. DNSChef also allows users to create custom DNS responses based off a set of configured rules which can be utilized to simulate attacks to test the effectiveness of other security tools.\nWhere did you get if from?\rIt was located in my Kali Linux, where it has a collection of different security tools. DNSChef was located in the Sniffing \u0026amp; Spoofing category. To get it on Windows, you can install it from this GitHub Repository: https://github.com/iphelix/dnschef.\nWhat problem does it solve?\rThis security tool can be used for a variety of different use cases such as bypassing network restrictions, spoofing DNS attacks, and redirecting malware DNS queries to a safe environment for further analysis.\nWhat data is needed?\rDNS Spoofing Attack\nDomain Name of Webpage\rIP Address of Machine with DNSChef\rHow do you test it?\rDNS Spoofing Attack Success\nI used Kali Linux VM (KVM) and Windows 10 VM (WVM) to test out DNS spoofing. I decided to choose http://www.example.com as my target site. In KVM, I opened up DNSChef and ran the command, ‘dnschef \u0026ndash;fakedomains=example.com \u0026ndash;fakeip=192.168.217.133 \u0026ndash; interface=192.168.217.133’. This command configures DNSChef to spoof DNS responses for the example.com domain and return the IP address 192.168.217.133 (KVM’s IPv4) each time the domain is requested. While this was running, I opened my WVM and configured my adapter options by going into the Ethernet’s properties and having the TCP/IPv4 use the KVM’s IP address as its preferred DNS server. The reason this was done was to ensure that all DNS queries was sent from the WVM to DNSChef and to simulate the spoofing event to understand how it would look in the terminal.\nBefore (Windows VM)\nAfter (Windows VM)\nReferences\rhttps://github.com/iphelix/dnschef\nhttps://medium.com/@STarXT/dnschef-a-comprehensive-guide-to-network-security-testing-and-monitoring-362c153953f0\nhttps://hellfire0x01.medium.com/get-familiar-with-dns-hijacking-2215a0a318d4\n","date":"10 June 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/projects/sectools/securitytools/","section":"Projects","summary":"\u003ch2\u003eWhat is it?\u003c/h2\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eDNSChef is a DNS proxy server that intercepts DNS queries and is developed in Python.

And these types of exchanges are meant to bypass the high car dealership fees and contactual obligations. Benefits\rAllow users to more easily manage their cost savings by allowing them to buy and sell used cars\rBeneficial as it would give them accessibility and freedom to connect with others and make transactional exchanges with theior used vehicles\rServes to cirvumvent the high car dealership fees and gives car owners the freedom to make fluid negotiations amongst themselves\rDescription\rThis application was done with a Team I worked alongside with. It was 4 people and divided between frontend and backend. The backend focused on SpringBoot with Eclipse and having the servers and database up on AWS. The Frontend used Visual Studio and was tasked with desigining the webpage and fetching API's to have it be displayed on the webpage. I created and populated the tables with MySQL and the data inputted was the vehicles available on the market and users that registered on the webpage. The Backend used Java to handle all the business logic and used Springboot because it simplified the building process, allowed for dependency injections, and was used to connect to the database.\rWe also used Git commands to constantly update our project by making push and pull requests from the repository. Lastly, the server and database was linked to AWS Elastic Beanstalk, while the website was being hosted on an S3 Bucket.
