It is used for analyzing malware and penetration testing and is a valuable tool for users as it allows them to filter DNS queries, redirect traffic, and poison DNS servers. DNSChef also allows users to create custom DNS responses based off a set of configured rules which can be utilized to simulate attacks to test the effectiveness of other security tools.\nWhere did you get if from?\rIt was located in my Kali Linux, where it has a collection of different security tools. DNSChef was located in the Sniffing \u0026amp; Spoofing category. To get it on Windows, you can install it from this GitHub Repository: https://github.com/iphelix/dnschef.\nWhat problem does it solve?\rThis security tool can be used for a variety of different use cases such as bypassing network restrictions, spoofing DNS attacks, and redirecting malware DNS queries to a safe environment for further analysis.\nWhat data is needed?\rDNS Spoofing Attack\nDomain Name of Webpage\rIP Address of Machine with DNSChef\rHow do you test it?\rDNS Spoofing Attack Success\nI used Kali Linux VM (KVM) and Windows 10 VM (WVM) to test out DNS spoofing. I decided to choose http://www.example.com as my target site. In KVM, I opened up DNSChef and ran the command, ‘dnschef \u0026ndash;fakedomains=example.com \u0026ndash;fakeip=192.168.217.133 \u0026ndash; interface=192.168.217.133’. This command configures DNSChef to spoof DNS responses for the example.com domain and return the IP address 192.168.217.133 (KVM’s IPv4) each time the domain is requested. While this was running, I opened my WVM and configured my adapter options by going into the Ethernet’s properties and having the TCP/IPv4 use the KVM’s IP address as its preferred DNS server. The reason this was done was to ensure that all DNS queries was sent from the WVM to DNSChef and to simulate the spoofing event to understand how it would look in the terminal.\nBefore (Windows VM)\nAfter (Windows VM)\nReferences\rhttps://github.com/iphelix/dnschef\nhttps://medium.com/@STarXT/dnschef-a-comprehensive-guide-to-network-security-testing-and-monitoring-362c153953f0\nhttps://hellfire0x01.medium.com/get-familiar-with-dns-hijacking-2215a0a318d4\n","date":"10 June 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/projects/sectools/securitytools/","section":"Projects","summary":"\u003ch2\u003eWhat is it?\u003c/h2\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eDNSChef is a DNS proxy server that intercepts DNS queries and is developed in Python.
